# What is kaizo?
Kaizo is a genre of highly difficult video game levels in the Super Mario series, originally created by T. Takemoto.
[reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizo)

The kaizo concept basically picks a game and makes its already existing components and game elements way harder and sometimes more unfair.
This can give an experienced player of a game a new and more challenging experience.

# The purpose of kaizo minecraft
The idea behind kaizo Minecraft is to make the game more challenging for experienced players.
Minecraft is already over a decade old and there are many skilled and experienced players.
Vanilla Minecraft can often be too easy fir them, especially due to recent updates which have changed a lot of game mechanics which sometimes makes the game less hard.
Compared to older versions of the game, you often see players getting very good gear and equipment within a couple hours of playing.
An example for instance, diamonds have become way more accessible and easier to get, by for example treasure chests or by mining with fortune. Or think of the many other enchants that make the game a lot easier.
This is where kaizo Minecraft comes into play. 
The kaizo plugin makes the difficulty on a server way higher to balance out overpowered gear and items.
This way Minecraft becomes harder again for knowledgeable and experienced players.
We hope to give these players a new, fun and sometimes more frustrating experience with the game, without having to play mudpacks or other systems that give new content to minecraft. 
With kaizo minecraft itâ€™s possible to play the game you know, but with more of a challange.
